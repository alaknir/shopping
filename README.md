This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

#### Using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

If you are using Create React App, instead of adding to your `package.json` as above, you will need to add a `src/setupTests.js` file to your app, to import jest-enzyme:

```js
// src/setupTests.js
import "jest-enzyme";
```

This is documented on Create React App at the bottom of the [Testing Components](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#testing-components) section. There is also more information about [Initializing Test Environment](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#initializing-test-environment).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
